## Modeling

The analysis employs a statistical model, specifically multiple linear regression, to analyze the relationship between various predictors and property prices. Factors such as location, property condition, and other attributes are considered to identify significant drivers of property value. The model provides insights into the impact of these factors on pricing, allowing DreamFlip Ventures to make data-backed decisions regarding property selection, renovation strategies, and optimal timing for resale.

## Regression Results

The regression analysis yielded several significant findings:

- Property location, particularly proximity to Lake Union, has a strong positive impact on property prices.
- Property condition is a crucial factor, with properties in poor condition priced lower than those in better condition. DreamFlip Ventures can leverage this by acquiring properties in poor condition and improving them to increase their value.
- The addition of one or two bathrooms positively affects property prices, providing an opportunity for DreamFlip Ventures to enhance the value of properties through strategic renovations.
- The model suggests that spring, with its favorable market conditions and increased buyer activity, could be a good season for purchasing properties in Lake Union.
